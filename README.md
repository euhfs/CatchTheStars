**False Positive Warning**

This .exe file was created using PyInstaller, which can sometimes trigger a false positive detection by antivirus programs like Microsoft Defender. This happens because PyInstaller packages the Python code into an executable, and some antivirus software mistakenly flags it as potentially harmful.

**Why This Happens**

When PyInstaller bundles Python applications into .exe files, it includes several components that might resemble the behavior of malware or potentially unwanted applications. As a result, some antivirus programs might wrongly flag it.

**What You Can Do**

If your antivirus (like Microsoft Defender) flags this file, you can safely add it to your antivirus exclusion list to stop the warnings.

**How to Add to Exclusion (Microsoft Defender):**
Open Windows Security by clicking on the Start menu, then searching for Windows Security.

1. Click on Virus & Threat Protection.

2. Scroll down and click on Manage Settings under the Virus & Threat Protection Settings section.

3. Scroll down to Exclusions and click Add or remove exclusions.

4. Click on Add an exclusion and select File.

5. Choose the .exe file you downloaded to add it to the exclusion list.

This will prevent your antivirus from flagging the file.
